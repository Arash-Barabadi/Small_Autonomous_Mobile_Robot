# How RTOS and Linux Work Together

## Rather than being rivals, RTOS and Linux often work together in hybrid systems:

###    Linux handles high-level tasks (UI, networking, cloud connectivity).
###    RTOS handles time-critical tasks (sensor processing, motor control, real-time decision making).

## For example, in robotics and IoT:

###    A Linux system (ROS 2) runs on a powerful microprocessor (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or x86 PC).
###    An RTOS (FreeRTOS, NuttX, Zephyr) runs on a microcontroller (e.g., STM32, ESP32) for real-time control.
###    Both communicate using ROS 2/micro-ROS for seamless integration.
