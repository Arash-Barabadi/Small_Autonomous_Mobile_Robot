## Originally, the robot continued moving indefinitely if no new /cmd_vel message was received (for example, when the Wi-Fi connection dropped or the teleop node stopped). This caused unsafe behavior â€” the last velocity command remained active and the robot kept accelerating or turning without control. To solve this, a command timeout watchdog was implemented. It continuously checks the time since the last received command and automatically stops both motors if no new command arrives within 250 ms
